## A try at implementing kotlin for clean architecture


This project will implement the clean architecture by building a voting system. 

The main components in this system will be;

1. Users - will hold a general view of all users in the system
2. Voters - Uses who are allowed to vote
3. Politicians - Users who are vying for specific posts
4. Posts - a position which a politician can run for and a voter can vote for
5. Vote - a vote that will be mapped to a specific voter, politician and post
